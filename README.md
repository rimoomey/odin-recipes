Project: Recipes for The Odin Project Foundations curriculum
This is the first project in The Odin Project Foundations track. By the end, I will have

(1) made a main website page in HTML
(2) used links to link to a few recipes

Reflection:
Created a multi-page website with links to all other pages inside the index.
Each page of the site itself has an image of the recipe I describe, as well as
both unordered and ordered lists, for the ingredients and steps, respectively.
