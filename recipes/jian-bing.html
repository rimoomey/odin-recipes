    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quick and Easy!</p>
    <p>There are many variations of Jian Bing, a.k.a. Chinese Crepe; this is only one. I use scallions and 
        cilantro in this recipe, but others use different ingredients, such as sunflower seeds. Instead of crackers 
        one can also use Chinese fried dough (You Tiao). Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons millet flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, if needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Chinese black bean sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Asian chile pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon torn fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>2 whole crackers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together millet flour, soy milk, and vegetable oil in a bowl to make a batter the consistency 
            of heavy cream. Add a teaspoon of water to thin the batter, if necessary.</li>

        <li>Mash the black bean sauce in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon of water to make it easy to spread. In a 
            separate small bowl, mix the hot chili sauce with 1 teaspoon of water. Set the sauces aside.</li>

        <li>Spray a large skillet generously with cooking spray, and heat over medium-low heat. Pour the batter into the 
            skillet, and spread evenly to make a thin crepe. Cook the crepe for 1 to 2 minutes, until firm. 
            Pour the egg evenly over the crepe. Cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until the egg is set. Sprinkle the 
            crepe with green onion slices and cilantro leaves, pressing them firmly into the cooked egg.</li>

        <li>Flip the crepe and spread with bean sauce and chili sauce. Place the crackers in the center of the crepe, leaving 
            about 1/4 inch of space between the two crackers. Flip the top third of the crepe down over the crackers, flip the 
            bottom third up, and then fold the crepe in half so the crackers are stacked on top of each other in a tidy 
            package. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
